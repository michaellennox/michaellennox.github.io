        <h1>Hi, I'm Michael and I'm currently working on becoming a web developer.</h1>

        <p>Right now I'm developing my skills in the basics: learning Ruby, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>As a person - I'm highly curious and love learning new things. My dream is to work in a role which let's me discover something new every day.</p>

        <h2>Professional Background</h2>

        <p>Born and bred in Yorkshire, I traded the beautiful dales for London's urban sprawl to study Medicine at UCL. 18 months in, I came to the realisation that a life in the medical field wasn't for me and jumped into the working world</p>
        <p>After leaving Medicine I entered a career in sales, first working as a team lead in a survey/sales role for a couple of the major energy firms and then taking up a Technical Recruitment role for the fantastic Explore Group - a mid-sized agency focused on the London market.</p>
        <p>While at the Explore Group, I ran one of our open source language desks focused on the python community and had the priviledge of working with a wide variety of London's greatest names in technology. It truly opened my eyes to how remarkable the tech community in London is and ignited a keen desire to get into a position where instead of helping from the sidelines, I could become intimately involved.</p>
        <p>After nearly 4 years of doing fairly well I'd managed to save up a sizeable chunk of money to tide me over and made the decision to pursue something that truly interested me.</p>
        <em>So here I am.</em>

        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>

        <p>Outside of work I'm your fairly standard "geeky" guy - my particular passions include: fantasy novels (far too many), music (performance), computers (athough that doesn't mean I can actually <i>do computers</i>), travel (anywhere's got nicer weather than England), DIY (the discovery of which confused everyone who ever knew me) and food (although I've no clue where it goes). In addition to this I enjoy continuous learning and have been studying various modules with the Open University (mostly mathematics, I'm weird like that).</p>
        <p>I'm not quite sure what else to write here so thanks for dropping by, do feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@michaellennox.me">get in touch</a>.</p>
