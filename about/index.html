        <h1>Hi, I'm Michael and I'm a Makers Graduate and Junior Developer</h1>

        <p>I'm a Makers Academy Graduate who's now working as a ruby developer in the big wide world.</p>

        <h2>Professional Background</h2>

        <p>Born and bred in Yorkshire, I traded the beautiful dales for London's urban sprawl to study Medicine at UCL. 18 months in, I came to the realisation that a life in the medical field wasn't for me and jumped into the working world</p>
        <p>After leaving Medicine I entered a career in sales, first working as a team lead in a sales role for an agency in the energy industry and then taking up a Technical Recruitment role for the fantastic Explore Group - a mid-sized agency focused on the London market.</p>
        <p>While at the Explore Group, I ran one of our open source language desks focused on the python community and had the priviledge of working with a wide variety of London's greatest names in technology. It truly opened my eyes to how remarkable the tech community in London is and ignited a keen desire to get into a position where instead of helping from the sidelines, I could become intimately involved.</p>
        <p>After nearly 4 years of doing fairly well I decided it was time for a change and went on the fantastic Makers Academy program where they taught me all those lovely things: writing clean, reusable code, passion for quality testing, and of course, the ability to put together applications in a wide variety of languages and technologies.</p>

        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>

        <p>Outside of work my particular passions include: fantasy novels (far too many), music (performance), travel (anywhere's got nicer weather than England), DIY (the discovery of which confused everyone who ever knew me) and food (although I've no clue where it goes). In addition to this I enjoy continuous learning and have been studying various modules with the Open University.</p>
        <p>I'm not quite sure what else to write here so thanks for dropping by, do feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@michaellennox.me">get in touch</a>.</p>
