            <h1>Hi, I'm Michael and I'm currently working on becoming a web developer.</h1>
            
            <p>Right now I'm developing my skills in the basics: learning Ruby, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>As a person - I'm highly curious and love learning new things. My dream is to work in a role which let's me discover something new every day.</p>
            
            <h2>Professional Background</h2>
            
            <p>Born and bred in Yorkshire, I traded the beautiful dales for London's urban sprawl to study Medicine at UCL. 18 months in, I came to the realisation that a life in the medical field wasn't for me and jumped into the working world</p>
            <p>After leaving Medicine I entered a career in sales, first working as a team lead in a survey/sales role for a couple of the major energy firms and then taking up a Technical Recruitment role for the fantastic Explore Group - a mid-sized agency focused on the London market.</p>
            <p>While at the Explore Group, I ran one of our open source language desks - "python developers" and had the priviledge of working with a wide variety of London's greatest names in technology. It truly opened my eyes to how remarkable the tech community in London is and ignited a keen desire to get into a position where instead of helping from the sidelines, I could become intimately involved.</p>
            <p>After nearly 4 years of doing fairly well I'd managed to save up a sizeable chunk of money to tide me over and made the decision to pursue something that truly interested me.</p>
            <p>So here I am.</p>
