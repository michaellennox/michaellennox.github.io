So the latest group I've got complete is a small squad of prosecutors, fairly happy with them but the wings are an absolute nightmare. I'll be trying a different wing style on a different squad before coming back to these and retouching them.

Basing is still to go, I'll crack all the starter set out together once I finish off the two heros.
