So it's happened.... we've completed the first week at Makers! _YAY_

A week of working through [boris-bikes](https://github.com/michaellennox/course/tree/master/boris_bikes) with [emma](https://github.com/michaellennox/boris-bikes), [giamir](https://github.com/michaellennox/boris-bikes/tree/giamir), [jamie](https://github.com/michaellennox/boris-bikes/tree/jamie) and [jonathan](https://github.com/michaellennox/boris-bikes/tree/jonathan) followed by the completion of the [airport challenge](https://github.com/michaellennox/airport_challenge) for our weekend assignment.

Looking back it's been amazing how fast we've picked things up, reaffirmed the ruby syntax knowledge we developed in the precourse (it's slightly creepy how instinctive this feels now) and learnt TDD & BDD from pretty much scratch. This week for myself has been relatively unchallenging, there were a lot of new concepts but nothing that required a huge "leap of cognition" to understand (although doubles were a bit of a nuisance initially).

I'm looking forwards to continue pounding along in week two!

### Most Important Things I Learned:

* Properly following a Test Driven approach to code, even just after the very small amount of coding I did prior to Makers it's felt... odd making the transition. I can't imagine how much of a mindfuck it would be to change to TDD/BDD after learning to build things.
* The basics of getting around RSpec. This week has provided a great intro window into the power and use of RSpec, but it's fair enough to say it's also displayed how much I don't know about it!

### Things I Struggled With The Most:

* Doubling implementation, the code block in the course notes doesn't work! (pull request with suggested changes submitted) which probably didn't help
* Getting used to working at different speeds with different pairs


### Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:

* Just keep going!
* Give myself a bit more "comfort" time, ensure I grab breakfast every day instead of coming in without grabbing something to eat and then feeling slightly fatigued by 12/12:30
