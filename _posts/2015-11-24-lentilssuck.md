title: Makers Week 1, Day 2 - Lentils Suck
category: rambleramble
tag: makers

So, I'm sitting here after the first day at makers. A couple glasses of a nice red down and crying inside because my lentils still aren't cooked in my stew 1 hour after I expected them to be! Turns out they take a while to cook... Dammit I'm hungry.

On a more on topic note, today was our first day coding as part of makers. It was definitely a jump in the deep end pushing us into brand new concepts such as BDD, TDD, OOP, DRY, SOLID as well as lots of pretty (and with a ridiculously high number of aliases) rspec syntax. If there's one thing I think I'm going to hate about rspec, it's that there's 5 or 6 different ways to carry out exactly the same test. Usability potentially taken a bit too much to the extreme?

It was a pretty awesome intro, we're working through a ["boris bikes"](https://github.com/michaellennox/boris-bikes) challenge which is pretty fun. As it's Makers, we're pairing from the get go and I must say it's fantastic. Having two minds in the same "headspace" as Tansaku keeps calling it definitely seems like a really productive way to code even with our herpy-derpyness (is that a word?) right now.

If there's one big thing to take away from today - it's take a damn break AS SOON AS you get stuck. We spent 30 minutes trying to diagnose a "stupid" problem that turned out to be us just calling the wrong method on our object in rspec and as such it kept kicking out error messages which made no sense in relation to what we were after...
