title: Don't try to learn SCSS in a day

We're now cracking on with the styling, pretty much everything is implemented apart from one angular component (the timeline feed of your activities) which may be temporarily be scrapped due to time constraints. Trying to learn to write scss in such a small amount of time is maybe not the best idea though.

The quality of the scss we're outputting is a bit varied, from disgusting mass nested things like [this](https://github.com/michaellennox/jobber/blob/development/public/scss/partials/lists/_companies.scss), to some fairly decent uses of the various mixins and plugins and whatever else the jazz comes with it in places like [this](https://github.com/michaellennox/jobber/blob/development/public/scss/partials/authentication/_landing.scss).

There's realistically one or two days left of work ahead before we need to be ready to present but we should be ok, just time to keep pushing forwards and try and get this wrapped up sooner rather than later.
