So, one of the big things we need to do is commit regularly which [I](https://github.com/michaellennox/oystercard/commits/master) [think](https://github.com/michaellennox/airport_challenge/commits/master) [I've](https://github.com/michaellennox/boris-bikes/commits/jamie) [been](https://github.com/michaellennox/oystercard/commits/andrew) [doing](https://github.com/michaellennox/boris-bikes/commits/jonathan) [fairly](https://github.com/michaellennox/boris-bikes/commits/master) [well](https://github.com/michaellennox/boris-bikes/commits/giamir), although I definitely need to work out a better way to structure my commit messages - _note to self, go go go!_

One thing I think though is important, particularly considering how much of my time is currently being taken up by the course is to ensure that I also keep doing other things in my life regularly. Don't miss meditation, don't miss writing a blog post reflecting on my day, don't miss doing little hobbies that I enjoy, don't miss yoga. Keep applying the same value to the rest of my life that I am to the time I spend on the course.
