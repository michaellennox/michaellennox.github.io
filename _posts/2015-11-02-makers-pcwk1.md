title: Makers Precourse Week 1 - The Command Line and Git
category: rambleramble

So - we're now through the first week of the precourse at Makers (Hooray!) and I've had the opportunity to get my teeth stuck back into a more indepth dive into the command line and git, both subjects I have studied before but as it appears, had a million and one things more to learn! This week has been pretty intense - supposedly it's "meant" to be around 15-20 hours to study the materials for the precourse but I (and by the sounds of it most others) have dived into various side and optional materials which definitely increase the amount of time studying!

If there's one big take away from my first week doing Makers' precourse - it's that there is a hell of alot to learn, but we will be learning it at an incredibly rapid rate.

Maybe the advice of "make sure you don't have a job when you start the pre-course" we heard in the intro session this week was well founded...

###Most Important Things I Learned:

* Getting a solid understanding of the command line - I already knew the basics but recovering the topic has let me get a much deeper understanding of combining commands.
* Relearning git to the level that I'm comfortable working from the command line with it. Also I now actually understand the use of it in a development environment much better.

###Things I Struggled With The Most:

* RegEx, I understand how they work now but have they haven't stuck in the memory at all. Will have to do some memory excercises to drill these in a bit.


###Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:

* Keep doing memory excercises to keep the command line and git commands fresh in my mind
* Get the chance to make use of it all as we move into ruby!

All in all, this week has been a lot of fun. Ruby weeks 2-4 here I come.
