title: Makers Precourse Week 2 - Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby

So our first week recovering Ruby as part of the precourse and it was a nice jump forwards. Topics for this week included a much deeper dive into Arrays and Methods and although most of the items were things I've had the opportunity to previously cover I picked up an enormous amount of new information which is floating around in my lovely head.

This was also my first time ever getting involved in pair programming, I had two nice long sessions with others on the course and felt a real sense of achievement in how much we managed to cover / gather during a pairing session. It feels more enjoyable, more productive and more sociable having someone on the other end of a Skype call working together in a shared editor instead of just tap tap tapping away on your keyboard by yourself.

###Most Important Things I Learned:

* Pairing! The magical wonders of pairing. Both times I paired this week we recovered material which I had already completed. Both times I paired this week I learnt an enormous amount that I hadn't thought about when tackling those problems solo. Two minds are far far better than one.
* Tests, tests, tests. I hit a few stumbling blocks in my challenges for this week where I had to go back and spend time afterwards to repair syntax errors or just simple mistakes. Would have saved myself the trouble if I had written small tests at the end of it and kept running as I went.

###Things I Struggled With The Most:

* Understanding the Singleton class. Need to be going back to this and look a bit further into it.
* Memorisation of methods. Started running a priority repetition system for memorising the method for Strings which is working wonders but need to do similar for the other classes sooner rather than later. It speeds up the coding a lot if I have the methods memorised instead of having to keep looking them back up.


###Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:

* Always write a set of tests before starting the main code. Test every single time I make a change.
* Complete anki-style decks for Arrays and the numeric classes.
* Don't just jump in right away, think about the structure before I start defining methods. Maybe write some pseudo-code so I know how everything will slot together before even writing any Ruby.

All in all, I had a lot of fun this week, got a great introduction to working as a pair and am very much looking forwards to getting stuck into some deeper concepts next week!
