title: Stormcast Eternal Liberators, first models in 10+ years

So I'm a self-confessed, slightly nerdy chap and one of my old hobbies was Warhammer and airfix miniatures. Having recently found a bit more time on my hands prior to starting at Maker's I decided it would be a great time to pick a modelling hobby back up so I grabbed the starter box for GW's new Age of Sigmar game.

Warning in advance - all these pages in the painting section are going to be pretty image heavy!

So here they are, my first couple of units in a good 10 (maybe even 15 years). Rather happy with them all in all and pleased I got back into painting - it's hugely therapeutic and relaxing for an exhausted mind. They still need basing but I'll get round to that as a single army.
