So the site is up and running! This is actually the second personal site I've assembled, the first was just a basic HTML / CSS thing that is going to live in the depths of my hard drive for ever, no way in hell is that ugly monstrosity coming out to play (imagine combining child with crayon + 90s web designer + pile of puke on the page).

All in all, I'm fairly happy with how everything has come out. As of writing this I've got a nice landing page, about.me page and the start of my blog section. It's set up to accept and link between posts although there's basically no formatting done yet, I think that'll be a task for early tomorrow morning.

If there's one thing that still needs some major changes - right now the site only really works with a landscape aspect around 720p and slightly above/below, when you hit 1080p it still works but some things start looking slightly odd and as soon as you go up to 1440p+ or any sort of portrait aspect ratio everything goes to pot. I've not done much work on developing sites for mobile yet or responsive design so as soon as I have this'll hopefully look a bit more functional.

A little bucket list of things for me left to do:

- Apply some CSS formatting and liquid templates to the blog section, stop it looking like a toddler just scribbled down some random thoughts and left them on the internet
- Go do some courses in responsive design & mobile design. Come back and make it work better for the more extreme aspect ratios
- Write some javascript code to add basic interactivity to the anchor tags in nav & front-page. I could just bring jQuery in but that seems rather wasteful to load a library so big to do something so small
- Compress that stupid landing img and set up alternates for other devices to improve loading
- Probably will be worth getting some form of social media presence I guess, although I've never been a huge fan
