Once again we've spent a bit more time working on Heroku, and having the headaches associated with debugging it. Then again, the logs are rather psychadelic and pretty so I guess it's not too awful...

It does seem like we manage to do something Heroku doesn't like on pretty much every build.

Today had the opportunity to recover much of the datamapper stuff and progress a bit further - particularly on understanding the concept of many-to-many. Today's app can be found [here](https://mysterious-eyrie-3184.herokuapp.com/links) and the codebase [here](https://github.com/michaellennox/bookmark_manager/tree/katie).
