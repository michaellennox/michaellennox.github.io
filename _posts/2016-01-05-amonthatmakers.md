title: A Month at Makers - and I Feel.... Epic

So here we are.... 1 month into my Makers journey (plus a couple weeks of Christmas fun) and what I've done is astounding.

From a starting point of a very very limited knowledge of development (a couple pretty bad html / css sites and the basics of Ruby), no understanding of TDD/BDD, no experience using web frameworks I feel like a god.

I can build a web app, I can enable persistence through databases, I can follow 'good' development methodologies, I can write pretty code, I can work effectively in a pair, I can jump onto a new codebase and get up to speed quickly...

A look back at all the things I've done over the first month at Makers:

##Boris Bikes

The study challenge for week 1 at Makers, our quick and dirty intro to TDD and the RSpec library.

During the week I worked on the following four code bases with different pair partners.

* [Day1 /w Emma](https://github.com/michaellennox/boris-bikes/tree/emma)
* [Day2 /w Giamir](https://github.com/michaellennox/boris-bikes/tree/giamir)
* [Day3 /w Jamie](https://github.com/michaellennox/boris-bikes/tree/jamie)
* [Day4 /w Jonathan](https://github.com/michaellennox/boris-bikes/tree/jonathan)

I also completed this challenge solo

and in Python

##Airport Challenge

The weekend challenge for week 1 at Makers, recap all the jazz we learnt in the week on a similar, but slightly different project.

I worked on this challenge solo.

##Oystercard Challenge

The Week 2 study challenge at Makers. This consisted of further work on pushing TDD into our brains, here we were introduced to slightly more advanced techniques such as Dependency Injection.

During the week I worked on the following five code bases with different pair partners.

* [Day1 /w Kirk](https://github.com/michaellennox/oystercard/tree/kirk)
* [Day2 /w Andrew](https://github.com/michaellennox/oystercard/tree/andrew)
* [Day3 /w Camilla](https://github.com/michaellennox/oystercard/commits/camilla)
* [Day4 /w Katie](https://github.com/michaellennox/oystercard/tree/katie)
* [Day5 /w Tom](https://github.com/michaellennox/oystercard/tree/tom)

I also worked on this challenge solo in Python

##Takeaway Challenge

The weekend challenge for week 2 at Makers, recapping what we learnt in Oystercard and getting a brief intro to interacting with an external API (in this case Twilio).

I worked on this challenge solo.

##Battle

The study challenge for Week 3 at Makers. Here was our grand introduction to building an app for the web giving us an intro to MVC frameworks and a basic play around in Sinatra.

During the week I worked on the following three code bases with different pair partners.

* [Day1 /w Ed](https://github.com/michaellennox/battle/tree/ed)
* [Day2 /w James](https://github.com/michaellennox/battle/tree/james)
* [Day3 /w Tony](https://github.com/michaellennox/battle/tree/tony) - [Heroku](https://battle-tony-version.herokuapp.com/)

##Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

The weekend challenge for week 3 at Makers, recapping what was done in Battle.

I worked on this challenge solo.

##Bookmark Manager

The study challenge for Week 4 at Makers. Here come the databases - and with them the capacity to build an app which can actually persist data and respond correctly to different users. Following this week I feel comfortable and confident that I could build pretty much any small scale web app in Sinatra without too much trouble!

During the week I worked on the following code bases with different pair partners.

* [Day1 /w William](https://github.com/michaellennox/bookmark_manager/tree/william)
* [Day2 /w Chris](https://github.com/michaellennox/bookmark_manager/tree/chris)
* [Day3 /w Katie](https://github.com/michaellennox/bookmark_manager/tree/katie)
* [Day4 /w Daniela](https://github.com/michaellennox/bookmark_manager/tree/daniela)
* [Day5 /w Andrew](https://github.com/michaellennox/bookmark_manager/tree/andrew)

I also worked on this challenge solo.

##Miscelanious Stuff

* Built a more complex templating system for the blog index
* Played around on a Raspberry Pi
* Studied topics including Robotics, Web Architecture and basic programming as part of my OU degree course
* Learnt enough vim to be able to make use of it without hurting productivity (although I think I'll probably just stick with Atom when possible)
