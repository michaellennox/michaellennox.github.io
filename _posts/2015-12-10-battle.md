So today we got our first vaguely awesome looking application up and running on the web. It's a piece of crap that hardly functions but looks pretty awesome (at least as far as I'm concerned) and it's a great feeling to get something a bit more visual than playing around in a command line.

The finished product at the end of Thursday from myself and [Tony](https://github.com/TY231618) is available [here](https://github.com/michaellennox/battle/tree/tony). The functionality of that branch was written before we paired yesterday and we spent most of the day styling it up to make a street-fighter-esque play page. As you will probably notice, none of the other pages have any styling yet!

Particularly pleased with the healthbar functionality which accurately fills to the current % of your character using only html, css and a tiny ruby method.
