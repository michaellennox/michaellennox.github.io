title: Makers Week 3 - Apps are away!
category: rambleramble

So this week we started with Sinatra - it's a hell of a lot of fun to actually get applications which have a bit more of a visual component than just a few words in the command line.

We worked upon [battle](https://github.com/michaellennox/battle) during the week, the [last version](http://www.michaellennox.me/rambleramble/2015/12/10/battle.html) of which I briefly wrote about at the time. I'll definitely have to go back to this one later in the course though - there's so many little things which need improving on / close to completely rewriting as it was sort of bashed together at the last minute.

For the weekend challenge we built a game of [Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock](https://github.com/michaellennox/rps-challenge) which you can feel free to go download and play! The styling was rather rushed through with bootstrap and just a basic colour scheme but I'm rather pleased with how the entire application came together at the end.

We have committed the cardinal sin of including global variables in our applications - but these are supposedly going to be able to phase out soon as we cover the fun of databases in week 4!

###Most Important Things I Learned:


* Sinatra - Great to work with a framework to make apps with a visual function
* More testing - feature tests make much more sense now

###Things I Struggled With The Most:

* Nothing really, it was all fairly smooth


###Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:

* Look forwards to removing global variables form my app
* Pat myself on the back for removing the sin of global variables
