title: Welcome to my Blog

Hi there and welcome. 

As a warning in advance: this is probably going to be the most boring and generic blog post you've ever read, so sit tight and fasten your seat belts.

This blog is being written for a few reasons:

- To help me keep a track of things as I learn
- Because occaisionally my mind spews word vomit and I may as well write it down
- Hopefully at some point to help other people learn development
- To fill the internet with random things about my life that you probably don't care about
