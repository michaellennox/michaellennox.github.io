So we're now commencing on the final projects, the last 2 weeks here at Makers before we get released on the wide open world!

I'm very happy to say one of the ideas I pitched at the final project jamboree got through and my awesome team will be working on it: Job Trackr, an information store and progress tracker for job hunters to give them access to the same quality of information sourcing and tracking tools that are available for employers and/or agents.

The initial planning goes ahead today, we're going to be running around with Python/Flask for our API and an AngularJS front end, should be interesting considering very few of us have any exposure to these technologies at all as of yet!
