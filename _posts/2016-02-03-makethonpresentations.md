Wow, that was exhausting. 2 days of code, a pretty much entirely new technology stack and we actually managed to make the damn thing work how we wanted. Brilliant and surprising. We also presented to the rest of the cohort which was for many of us the first chance to stand up in front of people and say 'here it is, this is what I made, it's really awesome!'

So here it is, netstix in all it's glory:

I'm pleased to say it's all fairly solid, there are a few elements that need a small amount of refactoring and also a couple of missing acceptance tests for the API but apart from that the whole thing works, it works how we wanted and we did that in two days.

# WE DID THAT IN TWO DAYS

Maker's Academy so far has been a transformative journey, a brilliant transformative journey where I learnt a million and one new things which make me excited and make me love life but it's always been with that little element of hand holding and guidance, this week, we went hell for leather and built a fully functional app in a stack we weren't familiar with that is fully tested (or at least almost), works how we wanted and with almost no guidance or support.

I feel pretty awesome.

If you fancy some more on the trials and tribulations of building a MEAN stack app with no clue during a craft-a-thon, the series for Makerthon is below:
