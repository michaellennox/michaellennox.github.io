title: Makers Precourse Week 3 - More Ruby
category: rambleramble
---

So this week was a great chance to get to grips with the "rest" of the basic Ruby syntax. We burnt our way through some more stuff on classes, made a few hashes, started getting to grips with some procs and got exasperated by rspec results. Most of the week's work was based around the remainder of Chris Pine's book - you can see some of my solutions [here](https://github.com/michaellennox/learn_to_program).

All in all, a fairly smooth week, apart from a few moments of ripping your hair out trying to work out what on earth the spec wanted you to do there was nothing too complex. Right now, I'm very much looking forwards to the final precourse week and then getting cracking with the main course!

###Most Important Things I Learned:

* The big steps this week came with depth of understanding and capacity to research. While we weren't introduced to many new topics (bar maybe procs) the remainder of Chris Pine was a lot more thought provoking and required you to extend your research to more than just the actual written materials. 
* Actually getting a grip on reading error messages & understanding what RSpec was spitting out at me meant fixing any issues was a lot faster than in the previous week.

###Things I Struggled With The Most:

* Lambdas vs Procs, still don't understand the differences very well. Need to play around with some more.
* Some of the challenges seemed particularly challenging due to spec / question not really matching up. As soon as I got to grips with actually reading the rspec output though it became a lot easier to work backwards from the spec in certain questions (hello Mr Orange Tree).
* I'm still pretty much lost when it comes to the "better" playlist shuffle challenge

###Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:

* Finally back in London so ACE Hotel here I come! Remote pairing is fun but I imagine working as a group and/or in person is going to be a lot more fulfilling.
* Learn more about RSpec, while I can understand what it's spitting out and read the code for the specs I couldn't write my own tests without references, let's try and find some decent resources around this.
