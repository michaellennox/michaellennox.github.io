So we're now at the end of week one and it's been one blitz of a week, It's absolutely remarkable how much of the application we've managed to get together in such a short amount of time.

If there's one thing to say - it's that the team is brilliant, everyone has learnt and picked up a brand new language and set of test tools in their stride, so thanks to [Hamid](https://github.com/genzade), [Andrew](https://github.com/andrew47), [Adam](https://github.com/adzz) and [James](https://github.com/jborrell).

In terms of tasks ahead - there's not a huge amount, almost all the API functionality is implemented, we just have a few angular components left to go and the styling (although that might be a nightmare and a half of a job in itself considering how extensive and varied the interface is probably going to be).

A relaxed weekend ahead and then it's time for the final push.
