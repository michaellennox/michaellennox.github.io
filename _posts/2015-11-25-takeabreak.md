So here I am, writing a quick post at the start of Day 4 at Makers Academy about Day 3. Yesterday was a lot of fun, starting work on a new and different code base felt slightly weird but we quickly got to grips with the fast change, the day's work can be seen on my [giamir branch](https://github.com/michaellennox/boris-bikes/tree/giamir) of [this repo](https://github.com/michaellennox/boris-bikes).

We moved quickly through a fairly long challenge and at 5:30 in the evening introduced ourselves to a brand new concept - mocking in RSpec. The basic idea, that you use a mocked class to ensure any changes you make to the real class doesn't screw up your tests, was fairly simple and easy to grasp but actually implementing it on the codebase was making our heads hurt slightly so we called it a night instead of continuing to push forwards through the pain.

Fast forward to this morning, I wake up bright and refreshed at 5am and purely on the back of yesterday's 5 minute skim read of mocking and doubles how I would implement it... just made sense. Breaks work! Apparently my mind while I slept somehow worked something out by itself that my conscious brain hadn't managed to grasp while I was awake.

Looking forwards to a new day and actually implementing my sudden realisation.
