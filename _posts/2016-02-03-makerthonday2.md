title: Makerthon Day 2 - Holy Shit We Can Code

Well today felt awesome. We were the gods of the MEAN stack as we blasted pretty much everything out the water!

The entirety of our User System, the extension of the Achievements resource and the brand new Submissions resource were all built in a single, slick day. It goes to show just how productive you can be when you have everything planned out and ready to go. The ticketing system was just an absolute lifesaver, we all got stuck in and moved at a pace which made the day before seem like a snail's pace.

You can view the repository's status at the end of day2 at [this repo](https://github.com/michaellennox/netstix/tree/c8dbb3cd889df602bbca8a3c587a8ac3d25a7ca2)

At this stage we had also carried out a total of 88 Github actions (pull requests or issues being raised) of which we had succesfully closed at least 67. While obviously in a 'real' project we wouldn't be working on quite as small tickets we got some brilliant practice in guiding our workflow and properly managing our development and deployment pipelines which we likely wouldn't have got if we wrote much larger tickets.

We had a working app, it functioned pretty much how we were hoping, there was just the pesky cases of setting up a CI system, deploying it and maybe adding in a couple of validations to make sure some random numpty didn't come and destroy our databases.
