So tonight was the very first night of Makers Academy (or the pre-course at least). A big open session where we paired to introduce each other, some wise words (I guess?) from our future mentors and then the obligatory beers!

All I can say is everyone is incredibly friendly, there's a remarkably diverse set of backgrounds (we have finance chaps, fresh grads, designers, a bar manager, a few Europeans, various consultants, one nutjob who ran 100km) and I think it's safe to say - we're all looking forwards to what comes next!
