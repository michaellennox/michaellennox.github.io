title: Makers Week 1, Day 1 - It's full steam ahead

So today was a brilliant intro, mostly lecture based (boo-hiss) but with the promise of being pretty much completely hands on apart from today (hooray!). We covered some fairly important stuff, of particular interest to me was the "Escalation Process" as they called it, or in other words, "how-to-work-your-way-through-an-error-you're-stuck-with". Supposedly devs find this concept difficult...? It drew a lot of parallels for me to how we would go around sourcing candidates in "out of market/cold" areas when I worked in recruitment, trust the system, follow a methodology rigidly and the answers will come! Start with the easiest/simplest/cheaper option then get progressively more complex/more time consuming/more expensive as you move through your process.

Looking forwards to tomorrow.
