Today came the presentation, the graduation, the finale. Our great and grand makers journey is complete although we were still rapidly trying to push forwards with hard coding the final sections as little as 1 hour before the presentation commenced.

There were some amazing projects here:

- [weJammin](https://github.com/saratateno/weJammin) - an interactive jamming session powered by websockets
- [pitchup](https://github.com/giamir/pitchup) - a platform to find people to join your sports team
- [hotel check in](https://github.com/Wynndow/hotel_check_in) - a faster way to check in to your room
- [senes](https://github.com/camillacolser/senes) - check in on your elderly relatives and make sure they're all fine
- [jobber](https://github.com/michaellennox/jobber) - an application tracking system and information store for job hunters

The night was brilliant and we're now done... It's time to start the job hunt.
