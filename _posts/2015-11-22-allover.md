__It's all over!__

Well, sort of at least. The precourse has finished and now we're getting ready to join the wonders that come from being at Makers' onsite and full time for the next 12 weeks. 600 hours of coding, here I come! (I have a bad feeling this might be a conservative estimate).

This week we had a nice little blitz through a [build our own website project](https://github.com/michaellennox/build-a-website). It would appear to have been a nice little intro to front-end technologies for those who may not have used their HTMLs, CSSs and JavaScripts yet but also gave us our first glimpse of the Sinatra framework. I made a quick [blog post](http://www.michaellennox.me/devramble/2015/11/17/motivational-posters.html) on the subject. The [repo is here](https://github.com/michaellennox/motivational-posters) and the [site is here](http://posters.michaellennox.me/). All in all, it was fun and gave us a lovely demonstration that a web framework doesn't have to be complex to use.

We also did that age-old programming interview question: [fizzbuzz](https://github.com/michaellennox/fizzbuzz) to introduce us to TDD and RSpec. Fun and enjoyable, my first face to face pairing experience and my mentor Mattia was pretty awesome.
