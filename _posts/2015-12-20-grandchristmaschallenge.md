title: The Grand Christmas Challenge - Learn a Language, Play With a Pi, Recap EVERYTHING
category: devramble
---

2 weeks off from Makers for Christmas...

As someone who's found the course a fairly level pace so far I'm very much looking forwards to this - it's a great opportunity for us to do something completely elective and recap on all those lovely things we've been introduced to so far.

So for my Christmas present to myself... I've got myself a Raspberry Pi (it also turns out my partner thought such an item would also be a lovely Christmas present, she was ever so dischuffed that I got it right before xmas). As part of my brilliant self-gifting abilities I also decided I want to learn something new - a slightly different language to Ruby that wouldn't be too conceptually complex to grasp but at the same time would give me exposure to something slightly different. Thus here comes Python!

So my plans for this Christmas:

* Drink a lot
* Eat a lot
* Learn Python, try to do all the challenges we've done so far in Python
* Drink some more
* Recap all the Ruby jazz - go back and redo the challenges
* Eat some more
* Build something without any guidance on the pi (at the moment I'm thinking a talking alarm clock) in Python
* Eat and Drink and Sleep

I'm looking forwards to it all! (Although I'm now back in Yorkshire and it turns out the family don't own ANY monitors with a HDMI port... what madness is this?!?!)
