title: Python - It Feels Like a Weird Lil' Beastie
category: devramble
---

I've started getting stuck into Python now and am looking forwards to getting cracking on rewriting the little 'Makers Projects' we did in Ruby in Python (and maybe if there's time I can also have a play around with either Django or Flask).

It feels a very intuitive language coming hot on the heels of working with Ruby - the syntax is almost identical to Ruby, just a bit less sugar and moving your mindset to 'everything is explicit' instead of Ruby's love for implicit feels slightly weird.

One thing I'm already hating - [these official docs are absolutely awful as a quick reference guide](https://www.python.org/doc/). Maybe I'm spoilt by the beauty of the rubydocs but the python documentation feels like it was written by someone who was writing a textbook, not a reference manual. Searching for stuff inside them is a nightmare and a half and questions are generally answered far more quickly by doing a search on SO instead of using the actual docs.

In other news I'm also doing a bit of playing around in vim (well actually I'm writing all python code in vim) and it's starting to make sense. The basic navigation is fairly simple soon as you've memorised the positioning of the hotkeys and I'm looking forwards to playing with a few additional tools when I come to actually writing small apps in it later this week.
