title: Building the blog index
---

So a vaguely relevant post as I convert my blog index from the basic jekyll format:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/blog-images/2015-09-22-ugly-blog.png" alt="ugly blog" width="980px">

To a slightly more sophisticated design with two columns:

![ALT pretty-blog][]

This post is a brief run-down of how I did it, it's also letting me practice markdown syntax for imgs & code fragments.

So jekyll's documentation gives you the basic framework for 

'''ruby
puts "Hello world!"
'''
